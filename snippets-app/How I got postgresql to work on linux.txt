# How I got postgresql to work on linux
# by Garrett Anderson:

# thinkful lessons want me to use some sandbox fake environment, but I do my stuff
# on my own computers and OS setups.  I use linux mint on most of my workstations,
# and ran into a lot of problems with permissions once I got postgresql installed
# Here is what I did to sort of alleviate the problem enough to be able to start working
# on the database.

sudo apt-get install postgresql
ps aux | grep postgresql # make sure it is running
sudo passwd postgres # changes password for postgresql default super user 'postgres'
su postgres # login as user postgres
createdb [whatever] # creates whatever database you want to start with
psql [whatever] #connects to whatever db as user postgres
(in postgresql terminal, connected to whatever db)
# make sure you spell your username exactly how it is in linux or osx or whatever
create user [your linux user name] with password '[whatever password you want]'; 
grant all privileges on database snippets to [the linux username you just set up];

######
now should be able to do stuff to db [whatever] as your usual linux user.  The above steps create a db from the default postgresql super user account 'postgres', then adds
your linux user as a user for the db you created, with full access and privledges.  Note
that this access is only good for that particular database, and this process will have to
be repeated for any other databases you create.


NOTE: Might want to add postgres user to main linux user's group for directory access?
usermod -a -G <groupname> username

gives errors about changing directories, but doesn't seem to affect anything. not sure how to fix this without creating massive security risks on the system.
